# TypeScript Curriculum

Welcome to the **TypeScript Curriculum** repository! This repo contains beginner-friendly lessons designed to help you understand how the JavaScript concepts you've already learned work in **TypeScript**.

This curriculum directly **mirrors our existing JavaScript lessons** — but instead of relearning everything from scratch, we’ll show you how to apply those familiar JavaScript concepts in TypeScript, and introduce new TypeScript-specific features along the way.

Our curriculum spans **a few weeks** and gradually builds from core concepts to more advanced TypeScript features. Each section of content aligns with the same topics you studied in JavaScript — but focuses on how TypeScript handles them.

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists

- To help beginners **transition from JavaScript → TypeScript smoothly**
- To show **clear, direct comparisons** between JavaScript and TypeScript
- To explain **TypeScript concepts clearly and practically**, in the same order you learned JavaScript
- To provide a **reference** you can return to even after the course
