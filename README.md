# TypeScript Curriculum (Weeks 1–4)

Welcome to the **TypeScript Curriculum** repository! This repo contains beginner-friendly lessons designed to help you understand how the JavaScript concepts you've already learned work in **TypeScript**.

This curriculum directly **mirrors our existing JavaScript lessons** — but instead of relearning everything from scratch, we’ll show you how to apply those familiar JavaScript concepts in TypeScript, and introduce new TypeScript-specific features along the way.

Our curriculum spans **4 weeks** and gradually builds from core concepts to more advanced TypeScript features. Each week aligns with the same topics you studied in JavaScript — but focuses on how TypeScript handles them.

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Topics (Mirrors JavaScript Weeks)                                                                                    | Files                                                            |

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/typescript-curriculum.git
```

2. Open the `week1` folder and open the `.html` files in your browser to start reading.

3. Use these lessons side-by-side with your existing JavaScript lessons to compare and understand how the same concepts work in TypeScript.

4. As we progress, we’ll add new folders (`week2`, `week3`, etc.) to mirror later JavaScript topics.

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists

* To help beginners **transition from JavaScript → TypeScript smoothly**
* To show **clear, direct comparisons** between JavaScript and TypeScript
* To explain **TypeScript concepts clearly and practically**, in the same order you learned JavaScript
* To provide a **reference** you can return to even after the course
