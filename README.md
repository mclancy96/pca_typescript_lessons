# TypeScript Curriculum (Weeks 1–4)

Welcome to the **TypeScript Curriculum** repository! This repo contains beginner-friendly lessons designed to help you understand how the JavaScript concepts you've already learned work in **TypeScript**.

This curriculum directly **mirrors our existing JavaScript lessons** — but instead of relearning everything from scratch, we’ll show you how to apply those familiar JavaScript concepts in TypeScript, and introduce new TypeScript-specific features along the way.

Our curriculum spans **4 weeks** and gradually builds from core concepts to more advanced TypeScript features. Each week aligns with the same topics you studied in JavaScript — but focuses on how TypeScript handles them.

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists

* To help beginners **transition from JavaScript → TypeScript smoothly**
* To show **clear, direct comparisons** between JavaScript and TypeScript
* To explain **TypeScript concepts clearly and practically**, in the same order you learned JavaScript
* To provide a **reference** you can return to even after the course
